# Levi
Levi is the bot that players interact with to navigate, and do things within the The Wild World. I want to flesh out more story about the world, and who Levi is and whatnot.

# Idea
An easy to update, easy to implement Discord virtual world game.
A virtual world, that has a market, and character population.
Players will be buying and selling items between one another. There will be rotating NPC's who sell things.
The bot is run by Levi, a young man with great ambition.

# Economy
Players can invest into a stock market. There is an ever-existing stock market of "NPC businesses" being traded. When a player creates a business, they can choose whether or not their business will buy or sell shares in the stock market.

# Player
I am removing marriage as a feature form the game, as it's form of bond is controversial. Instead, players will ensue in domestic partnerships if they so wish to use the features.

Players will need to feed themselves, tend to their thirst, sleep, maintain their sanity, and their primary character will have age. Players can only play as their children if their playership is unclaimed, and they claim them. If two players decide to have children together, two copies of every child is made, and the two players are required to tend to both copies. Players can choose to have a single child if they both vote for playership disabled.

Players are given a choice by Levi of which job they wish to attain from the Hold. Every player must choose a job, and start from here. There is no alternative, and will be no alternative. The three starting jobs are harvesting apples, chopping trees for lumber, or mining coal. Players get the choice of keeping the material they attain, or getting paid for trading in the material they attain.

Players can build skills in particular areas to produce better quality products.

Players will be able to buy property. That property can have pre-existing houses, or players can build houses onto them.

Players trade products, and their value will rise or fall in the market.

Players have hunger, thirst, energy, sanity, and age.

# Object Patents
Object Patents are a feature of the game that allows players to request for objects to be incepted into the game. Object Patents are formatted as so, and *every* item in the game requires an Object Patent, even ones introduced by developers.

# Discord Server
There are 3 Discord servers for The Wild World, and at least 3 bots respectively.
The primary Discord server is "The Wild World", which has the current stable version of Levi running.
The player testing Discord server is "The Wild World Unstable", which has the current unstable version of Levi running.
The developer testing Discord server "The Wild World Testing", which has the development version of Levi running.
There are 3 GitHub repositories, one for each Discord server.
The "Levi-Test-Robert-Reynolds" bot is the source for the primary testing repository, and other versions of the bot for developer will be forks of that repository.


### Setup
There are 5 primary categories of channels for players to communicate and interact within the world, which are the 5 capital cities of Capora, the planet players are on, otherwise known as "The Wild World":
- Harna
	- Hall of Health. the Great Capital of Capora
		- Public announcements are posted here.
		- There is a voice version of the Hall of Health for large meetings
	- Balton, the Stronghold of Capora's ruling government "The Hold"
		- Apply for loans.
		- Buy permits.
		- Get jobs.
- Lethro
	- Everpeak, the Leading Brokerage Service of Capora
		- Buy and sell stocks of public companies.
		- Create or invest in EFTs.

		- Post trades for other players to reply to.

A majority of gameplay will take place in other channels, but announcements, and dual-interactions (trades, combat, etc.) will be held within these channels.
