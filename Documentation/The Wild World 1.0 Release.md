I'd like [[Lani]] to make a roadmap here of the pets for 1.0 release. Simply put, what is expected for 1.0 release is something functional that is still what you'd deem playable, with a gameplay loop. I'll start by adding a few things, and let you go from there. I recommend making a good list for you to tackle, and then adding more, and tackling them in groups. Anything put on this list will be expected in the 1.0 release. If there are things you do not think can be implemented timely, that aren't required for the core gameplay loop, just put them here: [[The Wild World Taming]], and focus on the 1.0 release. Word should be concise, but not necessarily vague, I just tend to be vague. You can word them however you'd like.

### Pets
- [ ] Pets, Conceptualize Programmatic Architecture
- [x] Pets Panel Action Selection
- [x] Pets Panel Creature Collecting Menu
- [ ] Pets Panel Creature Sanctuary Menu
- [x] Pets Panel Creature Collecting, Manage Baits Menu
- [ ] Pets Panel Creature Collecting, Manage Baits Menu, Buy Bait
- [ ] Pets Panel Creature Collecting, Manage Baits Menu, Craft Bait
- [x] Pets Panel Creature Collecting, Manage Enclosures Menu
- [ ] Pets Panel Creature Collecting, Manage Enclosures Menu, Buy Enclosure
- [ ] Pets Panel Creature Collecting, Manage Enclosures Menu, Craft Enclosure
- [ ] Pets Panel Creature Collecting, Manage Traps Menu

(Instead of a bait menu, create a catching menu with bait and taming options. First you have to bait a creature by placing down an enclosure with a specific tier of bait, then you have to perform an action to tame the trapped creature. After you have tamed the creature you can then name it and begin building a relationship with it. Once you reach a certain level of relationship with the creature, you can start to train it for battles.)
